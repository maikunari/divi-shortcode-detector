# divi-shortcode-detector
Creates a Divi Shortcodes menu so you can find all pages using divi - and rebuild them without divi. 

I had a site built with Divi Builder plugin, all mixed in with gutenberg pages.  This plugin creates an admin item with a simple list of pages that have divi shortcodes on them so you can find them easily.
